# AI Search Algorithms for Smart Mobility

This is the GitHub repo of the UofT grad course ECE1724H: Bio-inspired Algorithms for Smart Mobility. This course highlights the power of AI in solving complex problems that arise in smart mobility systems & services such as multi-criteria optimal routing, emergency dispatch and routing for first response emergency vehicles, personal transporter planning, ridesharing, ride-hailing or ridesourcing, dynamic pricing, dynamic on-demand mobility services, multi-modal transportation planning, last-mile delivery systems using droids/cargo-bikes, deadheading problem, platooning or flocking and fleet management to name just a few.
