Just as the arrival of the first automobiles fundamentally changed our society in the early 1900s, smart mobility systems will trigger evolutionary and revolutionary changes in city planning. Infrastructure problems are planning problems that aim at optimizing the placement, allocation, distribution or the usage of physical or digital assets such as 
- traffic monitoring sensors
- charging points/stations
- walking routes and cycling lanes for active, soft, and inclusive mobility
- emergency safe spots/harbor planning
- road signage placement
- micromobility station placement. 

The following examples will be covered in this section to showcase some ill-structured infrastructure problems:
